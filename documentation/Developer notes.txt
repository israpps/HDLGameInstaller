To compile this software, you need:
1. An updated PS2SDK (https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk).
2. libpng and all its dependencies (zlib and libmath). If you can't compile libpng for use on a Windows development environment, you may need to do so in Linux before copying the compiled library over.
3. gsKit, as well as FreeType and its dependencies.
