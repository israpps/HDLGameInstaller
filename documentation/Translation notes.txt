The PlayStation universally supports 8 languages:
1. Japanese
2. English
3. French
4. Spanish
5. German
6. Italian
7. Dutch
8. Portuguese

These languages are also supported on certain models (localized fat PS2s and all slimlines), but aren't recognized by the System Configuration (SCF) library that Sony uses in games:
1. Russian
2. Korean
3. Traditional Chinese.
4. Simplified Chinese

***At this point, only the basic 8 languages are supported.***

Customizable files under the "lang" folder:
	fonts.txt	-> Contains the filenames of the font to use for each language. One file on each line for each language.
	labels_XX.txt	-> Contains labels. One label per line. This file should be saved in the UTF-8 encoding.
	strings_XX.txt	-> Contains strings (messages). One string per line. This file should be saved in the UTF-8 encoding.
	*.ttf		-> Font files. Only files specified in fonts.txt will be used. If your language needs characters not found in the English script, add a font file that can be loaded by FreeType and update the appropriate line within fonts.txt.

	XX = a two-letter code representing each language. If the file cannot be loaded, the system will use its defaults (English-language resources).
